# Improving the performance of an investment fund

## Background

You work as an analyst at an investment fund in New York. Your CFO wants to explore if it is a good idea to invest some of the fund's assets in Bitcoin. You have to prepare a report on this asset and how it compares to the stock market in general.

## Your challenge

Create a report that covers the following:

- How does the performance of Bitcoin compare to the S&P 500 and the price of gold?

- Analyze Bitcoin's returns and volatility profile. Do you believe it could help improve the performance of a portfolio? Do you believe Bitcoin could be used as a hedge versus inflation?

- The CFO is looking to lower volatility in the fund. Explore building a portfolio using some or all of these assets. Make a recommendation that minimizes overall risk.
